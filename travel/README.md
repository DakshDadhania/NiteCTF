This link is what you got.

The image has a the url hidden/link which redirects to a google jamboard.

# [Jamboard link](https://jamboard.google.com/d/14VL-FK7SIraeMnAEx_1DgpKaVY21_VO4Cfspmw3wdh4/edit?usp=sharing) - https://jamboard.google.com/d/14VL-FK7SIraeMnAEx_1DgpKaVY21_VO4Cfspmw3wdh4/edit?usp=sharing

Behind The 12pm Meeting note in the jamboard there exists a link to the website!!!

The jamboard has the link to the website  eg : https://apporima.com/  (LINK NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BY TH ORIGINAL SERVER URL AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT)!!!

source code of the website gives them this hint 

 <p> <b>Go Back in time and get the previous month's menu!!!</b></p>indicating that it was earlier deleted and waybackmachine has to be used!!!

Hence by using way back machine to https://apporima.com/flag.txt (LINK NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BY THE ORIGINAL SERVER URL AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT)!!!


we get the flag
